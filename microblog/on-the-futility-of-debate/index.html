<meta property="og:description" content="Four years ago, to be precise, on April 19, 2019, a captivating debate took place at Meridian Hall in Toronto, Canada between Canadian psychologist and political scientist Jordan Peterson—who, by the way, is a staunch critic of Marxism and &ldquo;identity politics&rdquo;—and the Slovenian philosopher and cultural critic Slavoj Žižek—a communist in his own way and a Hegelian—on the relationship between Marxism, capitalism, and happiness. Both, despite the endless ideological disagreements they must have, found points in common regarding political correctness or &ldquo;woke capitalism&rdquo; and economic regulation within the capitalist system, as well as disagreements that I will not descend to analyze.
That pathetic debate served as an example both for me and for, I think, people who think like me how we can distance ourselves from a subject that we presupposed to be minimally educated and side with his ideological counterpart, in this case Žižek. I firmly believe that, in order to criticize an author, we should carefully read his work so as not to create straw men and engage in circular reasoning, as was the case with Peterson who thought that the opponent he was facing was nothing more than a bland charlatan like the ones he used to face in television talk shows where feminism, queer theory and the tiring postmodernism that prevails in Western society were discussed." />

      <p>Four years ago, to be precise, on April 19, 2019, a captivating debate took place at Meridian Hall in Toronto, Canada between Canadian psychologist and political scientist Jordan Peterson—who, by the way, is a staunch critic of Marxism and &ldquo;identity politics&rdquo;—and the Slovenian philosopher and cultural critic Slavoj Žižek—a communist in his own way and a Hegelian—on the relationship between Marxism, capitalism, and happiness. Both, despite the endless ideological disagreements they must have, found points in common regarding political correctness or &ldquo;woke capitalism&rdquo; and economic regulation within the capitalist system, as well as disagreements that I will not descend to analyze.</p>
<p>That pathetic debate served as an example both for me and for, I think, people who think like me how we can distance ourselves from a subject that we presupposed to be minimally educated and side with his ideological counterpart, in this case Žižek. I firmly believe that, in order to criticize an author, we should carefully read his work so as not to create straw men and engage in circular reasoning, as was the case with Peterson who thought that the opponent he was facing was nothing more than a bland charlatan like the ones he used to face in television talk shows where feminism, queer theory and the tiring postmodernism that prevails in Western society were discussed.</p>
<p>But more important, in fact, is knowing that he showed me that debates are just operas where two subjects are going to exchange words not to reflect, much less to reformulate their convictions, but to reinforce them. There is the fact that many debates are focused entirely on the discussion of a single topic that has already been discussed ad nauseam before, as if they were futile orchestras organized by someone without ideas or creativity of any kind.</p>
<p>Those of us who get involved in a debate have a preconceived objective and that, probably, will be to weigh the coherence of our rhetoric over that of the other. This invites us to a series of epics with which we mentally masturbate thinking that we have used our opponent to mop the floor—a fun way of saying that we have destroyed him—and, of course, unless we are idiots we will realize if the The public has subscribed to what we have said or to what our opponent uses to counterargue. The disenchantment with our own convictions can have a place in our flow of thoughts, either because we have entered into dissonance with ourselves or because we have found coherence in what our rival has had to say, however, books exist for something, right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s think about a valuable concept that economic science has left us: the division of labor. Different people fulfill different roles in society. Speaking in these terms, there are those who provide information and those who receive it. It should not surprise anyone that, for some time now, I have dedicated myself to writing pests that do not necessarily imply the defense of something in particular even when I want to be serious about certain topics. There is a reason why some people are dedicated only to developing and transmitting information. It is a talent that not everyone has or can acquire. The fact that two people share the same ideas does not make them equal. One will have a better pen to put them down. If this were not so, then everyone would be excellent writers. But that&rsquo;s not how human nature works: we were never a species destined for equality of conditions or results.</p>
<p>Debates are futile precisely because their nature makes them circular. It is not the exchange of ideas that will invite one of the members to reflect, but their imminent—and perhaps painful—shock with reality. Therefore, it will be up to him whether to reflect or remain outside its parameters, either critically or uncritically; dogmatic or non-dogmatic. As if that were not enough, and I reiterate and insist: <strong>we are not destined for equal conditions or until the last of our days</strong>. No matter what the ideas, and given the few benefits of engaging in a potentially everlasting discussion, I&rsquo;ll find that making poetry with programming, reading a book or leaving the house for a while will be much more productive than teaching a demented to count the radishes on a banana. It is so, and so it&rsquo;ll always be.</p>
