						The Importance of Programming in Pure Mathematics
					</a>
				</h2>
        <p><p>Regarding the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mathematics/comments/134z3nz/studying_theoretical_pure_mathematics/">publication</a> that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/visxme/">Marcelinka (u/visxme)</a> posted in which he asked if a minimum or advanced knowledge of physics and programming was necessary to study &ldquo;pure theoretical mathematics&rdquo;, I decided to write this to clarify a little more why it is so important to move in a minimally efficient way with programming if you are going to dedicate yourself to mathematics, regardless of whether these are &ldquo;theoretical&rdquo; or &ldquo;practical&rdquo;. It should be noted that with this I am not forcing any mathematician in training to enter programming professionally, but I am motivating him to learn the basics of it.</p>
<p>My answer to that question was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The interaction between mathematics and physics in recent years has intensified thanks to the invention of string theory, so yes, some physics will be important but not absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>I see that you&rsquo;re counterposing the practical point of view with the theoretical - theoretical mathematics does not require programming, however, if at any time you need to go to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_proof">computer-assisted proof</a>, that is, mathematically corroborate a result using a computer, perhaps moving with a programming language such as Python or MATLAB (for data analysis or model design) will be useful. At some point you could get out of the &ldquo;theoretical&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my answer I proposed to detail, very briefly, three very important things: <strong>a)</strong> theoretical mathematics does not require being a programmer or, at least, it will not require it, however, <strong>b)</strong> the above does not imply that they will not be necessary at some point or moment, on the contrary, it will be the case that they will be mandatory and <strong>c)</strong> in the few cases, if not in any, it is necessary to know more than one language programming, it&rsquo;s enough with a competent handling of it to excel.</p>
<p>Computing as both a theoretical and a practical discipline drinks entirely from mathematics. Sooner or later, in fact, whoever sets out to study programming will end up stumbling across arithmetic and, perhaps, physics or algebra both I and II. Today, mathematics is highly crucial for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_proof">computer-assisted proof</a>, that is, the use of programming or a computer to prove the veracity of a particular result.</p>
<p>It is also well known that there are those who have dedicated themselves to proving the relationship of mathematical proofs with software development (e.g., <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondencia_de_Curry-Howard">Curry-Howard isomorphism</a>). Well, there is the curious case in which programming―which is closely linked to software development―has given rise to projects such as the <a href="https://www.mersenne.org/">Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search</a>, whose the sole purpose is nothing more than to socialize the use of a program that allows anyone to compute <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_prime">Mersenne primes</a>. No one, I think, will be willing to say that without programming this project would be possible.</p>
<p>The advances that are taking place in quantum computing have given rise to a series of new facilities for solving or understanding problems from physics and mathematics, making the calculation of extremely large numbers more feasible. However, there is another point that I think deserves to be underlined and that is how much fun it can be to apply mathematics to programming in the form of terminal programs or games for purely recreational purposes.</p>
<p>Such reasons lead me to think that programming is not only essential for visualizing abstract problems from a different perspective and, with it, for strengthening the logical analysis of a problem, but also for the protection of information. The academic Benjamin Rubinstein of the University of Melbourne insisted, in an <a href="https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/understanding-the-maths-is-crucial-for-protecting-privacy">article</a> written together with two other academics, on the crucial role of mathematics in the protection of user privacy. Similarly, computer scientist Phil Zimmermann posited the widespread use of cryptography for the protection of individual data while warning about the far-reaching differences between old-fashioned and digital communication and how it can be used to facilitate espionage.</p>
<p>It is for these reasons that mathematics and adjacent areas such as cryptography or physics must be combined with a not very extensive study of programming, although if you want you can dedicate yourself fully to it. However, programming can be useful to anyone who wants to bring mathematical ideas into programming in such a way that the outgoing tool is available to everyone, if what you have programmed in the first instance has practical applications that go beyond being a demonstration to a problem.</p>
<p>So, yes, knowing how to use a computer and getting around with programming is elementary for anyone who is dedicated to pure mathematics. Sooner or later you will stray from the theoretical to the practical, even by accident, and you will need something from it.</p>
<p>It is a desire for knowledge and elegant demonstrations expressed in code.</p>

						The Programmer as an Applied Linguist
					</a>
				</h2>
        <p><p>It&rsquo;ll not be a secret to anyone that both programming and mathematics have a tremendously elementary link, we could focus on asserting that, in fact, programs are mathematical demonstrations per se. This link is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence">Curry-Howard correspondence</a>, and it establishes the above through the existing isomorphism between formal type systems for certain computational models and certain formal proof systems.</p>
<p>Beyond the technical postulates on which the aforementioned correspondence rests and, ultimately, the flagrant relationship that mathematics has with programming. It&rsquo;d be convenient to portray—if you haven&rsquo;t noticed it yet—the enormous correspondence that emerges, and which deals with the relationship between linguistics and programming, since in both areas the study of the fundamental structures of language, its variations across all language families—which it also identifies and classifies—and the conditions that make understanding and communication possible through natural language is central.</p>
<p>In recent years it has become a common practice among computational linguists to analyze languages using computers. Programmers have to speak &lsquo;computerally&rsquo;, that is, they have to communicate with computers using some language like C, Pascal, SQL or even machine code. Programming languages are imperative, and it will be through them that we will be able to maintain effective communication with a machine. We learn a computer language using the same faculties that we learn our own human language, intuitively, without a deep understanding of what is going on in our brain.</p>
<p>It seems that both approaches have the same goal: to allow people and computers to communicate freely. However, both are quite extreme. The above approach wants to teach computers to speak English, without taking into account that computers are not humans and therefore cannot speak English, or at least cannot speak proper, complex, nuanced, and complex human English. ambiguities. The latter approach wants humans to speak fully computerized (at least when talking about machine code; other programming languages are a bit friendlier to humans) and doesn&rsquo;t recognize that humans aren&rsquo;t computers and often have problems to deal with things that seem really simple from the computer.</p>
<p>Indeed, and as you may have already realized, a programming language is almost like a natural language. However, a programming language is inherently imperative. His intention, after all, is not for us to have a cryptic conversation with our machine but to order the machine to do something specific, the interpreter or compiler being in charge of mediating that communication by converting the code we have written into machine code. Human language, on the other hand, is not as mechanical and deterministic as a programming language, where communication is.</p>
<p>As computing has evolved, programming languages have become less bureaucratic and considerably more flexible than their archaic counterparts. This has given the achievement of high-level programming, which has come to replace the bureaucratic low-level programming that required interacting with the architecture of the machine that the program was going to address. This &ldquo;debureaucratization&rdquo; has gone hand in hand with an increase in the readability of the code and its syntax to make it easier for anyone to expose the code orally. Such is the situation that computational linguistics could one day lead to computers understanding, analyzing and translating all texts and languages. Computers can even use language just as well as humans. This is why markup tools like <a href="https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/index.html">LaTeX</a> are so popular among linguists.</p>

						On the Futility of Debate
					</a>
				</h2>
        <p><p>Four years ago, to be precise, on April 19, 2019, a captivating debate took place at Meridian Hall in Toronto, Canada between Canadian psychologist and political scientist Jordan Peterson—who, by the way, is a staunch critic of Marxism and &ldquo;identity politics&rdquo;—and the Slovenian philosopher and cultural critic Slavoj Žižek—a communist in his own way and a Hegelian—on the relationship between Marxism, capitalism, and happiness. Both, despite the endless ideological disagreements they must have, found points in common regarding political correctness or &ldquo;woke capitalism&rdquo; and economic regulation within the capitalist system, as well as disagreements that I will not descend to analyze.</p>
<p>That pathetic debate served as an example both for me and for, I think, people who think like me how we can distance ourselves from a subject that we presupposed to be minimally educated and side with his ideological counterpart, in this case Žižek. I firmly believe that, in order to criticize an author, we should carefully read his work so as not to create straw men and engage in circular reasoning, as was the case with Peterson who thought that the opponent he was facing was nothing more than a bland charlatan like the ones he used to face in television talk shows where feminism, queer theory and the tiring postmodernism that prevails in Western society were discussed.</p>
<p>But more important, in fact, is knowing that he showed me that debates are just operas where two subjects are going to exchange words not to reflect, much less to reformulate their convictions, but to reinforce them. There is the fact that many debates are focused entirely on the discussion of a single topic that has already been discussed ad nauseam before, as if they were futile orchestras organized by someone without ideas or creativity of any kind.</p>
<p>Those of us who get involved in a debate have a preconceived objective and that, probably, will be to weigh the coherence of our rhetoric over that of the other. This invites us to a series of epics with which we mentally masturbate thinking that we have used our opponent to mop the floor—a fun way of saying that we have destroyed him—and, of course, unless we are idiots we will realize if the The public has subscribed to what we have said or to what our opponent uses to counterargue. The disenchantment with our own convictions can have a place in our flow of thoughts, either because we have entered into dissonance with ourselves or because we have found coherence in what our rival has had to say, however, books exist for something, right?</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s think about a valuable concept that economic science has left us: the division of labor. Different people fulfill different roles in society. Speaking in these terms, there are those who provide information and those who receive it. It should not surprise anyone that, for some time now, I have dedicated myself to writing pests that do not necessarily imply the defense of something in particular even when I want to be serious about certain topics. There is a reason why some people are dedicated only to developing and transmitting information. It is a talent that not everyone has or can acquire. The fact that two people share the same ideas does not make them equal. One will have a better pen to put them down. If this were not so, then everyone would be excellent writers. But that&rsquo;s not how human nature works: we were never a species destined for equality of conditions or results.</p>
<p>Debates are futile precisely because their nature makes them circular. It is not the exchange of ideas that will invite one of the members to reflect, but their imminent—and perhaps painful—shock with reality. Therefore, it will be up to him whether to reflect or remain outside its parameters, either critically or uncritically; dogmatic or non-dogmatic. As if that were not enough, and I reiterate and insist: <strong>we are not destined for equal conditions or until the last of our days</strong>. No matter what the ideas, and given the few benefits of engaging in a potentially everlasting discussion, I&rsquo;ll find that making poetry with programming, reading a book or leaving the house for a while will be much more productive than teaching a demented to count the radishes on a banana. It is so, and so it&rsquo;ll always be.</p>
