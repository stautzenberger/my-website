Welcome to sheikyon.me, I’m a full-stack developer (software developer) enthusiastic about computing, programming, electronics and free and open-source software. In addition to everything that is even slightly close to computers, I also have a deep interest in mathematics, economics, philosophy, sociology, history, and anime. If you take a closer look at this space, you’ll realize that these are the main topics that are usually addressed very regularly in my articles/posts on my website.">

      <p>It&rsquo;ll not be a secret to anyone that both programming and mathematics have a tremendously elementary link, we could focus on asserting that, in fact, programs are mathematical demonstrations per se. This link is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence">Curry-Howard correspondence</a>, and it establishes the above through the existing isomorphism between formal type systems for certain computational models and certain formal proof systems.</p>
<p>Beyond the technical postulates on which the aforementioned correspondence rests and, ultimately, the flagrant relationship that mathematics has with programming. It&rsquo;d be convenient to portray—if you haven&rsquo;t noticed it yet—the enormous correspondence that emerges, and which deals with the relationship between linguistics and programming, since in both areas the study of the fundamental structures of language, its variations across all language families—which it also identifies and classifies—and the conditions that make understanding and communication possible through natural language is central.</p>
<p>In recent years it has become a common practice among computational linguists to analyze languages using computers. Programmers have to speak &lsquo;computerally&rsquo;, that is, they have to communicate with computers using some language like C, Pascal, SQL or even machine code. Programming languages are imperative, and it will be through them that we will be able to maintain effective communication with a machine. We learn a computer language using the same faculties that we learn our own human language, intuitively, without a deep understanding of what is going on in our brain.</p>
<p>It seems that both approaches have the same goal: to allow people and computers to communicate freely. However, both are quite extreme. The above approach wants to teach computers to speak English, without taking into account that computers are not humans and therefore cannot speak English, or at least cannot speak proper, complex, nuanced, and complex human English. ambiguities. The latter approach wants humans to speak fully computerized (at least when talking about machine code; other programming languages are a bit friendlier to humans) and doesn&rsquo;t recognize that humans aren&rsquo;t computers and often have problems to deal with things that seem really simple from the computer.</p>
<p>Indeed, and as you may have already realized, a programming language is almost like a natural language. However, a programming language is inherently imperative. His intention, after all, is not for us to have a cryptic conversation with our machine but to order the machine to do something specific, the interpreter or compiler being in charge of mediating that communication by converting the code we have written into machine code. Human language, on the other hand, is not as mechanical and deterministic as a programming language, where communication is.</p>
<p>As computing has evolved, programming languages have become less bureaucratic and considerably more flexible than their archaic counterparts. This has given the achievement of high-level programming, which has come to replace the bureaucratic low-level programming that required interacting with the architecture of the machine that the program was going to address. This &ldquo;debureaucratization&rdquo; has gone hand in hand with an increase in the readability of the code and its syntax to make it easier for anyone to expose the code orally. Such is the situation that computational linguistics could one day lead to computers understanding, analyzing and translating all texts and languages. Computers can even use language just as well as humans. This is why markup tools like <a href="https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/index.html">LaTeX</a> are so popular among linguists.</p>
