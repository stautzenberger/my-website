<p><img src="/res/1_4scy_xyPtcJqQ-w05Khnxw.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The economist and expert in economic history <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_P._Kindleberger">Charles Kindleberger</a> came to assert that “the State proposes and the market disposes” referring to the demarcations of the State and the market in an economy. The heterodox school of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartalism">Chartalism</a> proposed that, rather than being a spontaneous solution to the limitations of barter as an exchange pattern, the artificer of money is the State and only the State can specify what money is: gold, promises of payment, unbacked paper.</p>

    </figure>
  


<p>Some time before, however, Carl Menger—founder of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School">Austrian School of Economics</a>—masterfully demonstrated that money arises spontaneously and outside of regulations; for the Austrian, money becomes highly liquid merchandise that, moreover, can preserve its value over time. In 1912, Ludwig von Mises tried to go one step further by formulating his regressive theorem: money in the strict sense arises from those liquid goods that have a prior non-monetary demand. Satoshi Nakamoto, perhaps unknowingly, rebels against Chartalism and the Misesian vision at the same time, and in doing so recovers the Mengerian argument: Bitcoin never had a previous monetary demand and, nevertheless, it seeks to consolidate itself as a pure and unalterable money whose adoption depends entirely on the evolutionary process.</p>

<p>Kindleberger had very little of a libertarian. Rather, he could be considered a dollar maximalist, since his main interest was in establishing a monetary hegemony that would generate both economic and political stability. A Wilsonian through and through, he viewed American leadership in global affairs as a moral imperative. If he was to watch over international balances in the destiny of America, it would be better for the empire to assume a role that until then was reserved for central banks; the United States was to serve as a lender of last resort, a liquidity provider, a custodian of exchange rates, a market maker. Not surprisingly, these ideas propped up Kindleberger as one of the leaders of the Marshall Plan.</p>
<p>Barter, as we know it today, was born within certain tribes in primitive Mesopotamia and was adopted by the Phoenicians. The Phoenicians traded goods with those located in various other cities across the oceans. The Babylonians also developed an improved barter system. Goods were exchanged for food, tea, weapons, and spices. Sometimes human skulls were also used. Salt was another popular item traded. The salt was so valuable that the salaries of the Roman soldiers were paid with it. In the Middle Ages, Europeans traveled the world to trade crafts and furs for silks and perfumes. Colonial Americans traded musket balls, deerskins, and wheat.</p>
<p><img src="/res/bartering.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Conceptually, a barter is an exchange system mediated bilaterally or multilaterally in which the parties inserted in the contract will agree to a transaction by which a good or a service will be exchanged. Behind the barter, there were no public institutions, centralized financial entities or central banks — this is evident in that the procedure is based on a simple exchange between goods, whether it is exchanging a crop of corn for help to harvest the harvest; a basket of apples for a soccer lesson or something as mundane as exchanging a steel bar for a tree trunk. We might be inclined to say that barter was, in fact, the first decentralized exchange pattern in history.</p>
<p>Little by little, however, as barter transactions became more common, more limitations of barter began to show themselves. One of the most significant of these was the impossibility of carrying out an exchange if one of the participants in the transaction did not seek the only good that one of the parties intended to exchange. Suppose a farmer who had a dozen eggs wanted to buy a pair of shoes, to do so he would have to find a shoemaker who was willing to buy a carton of a dozen eggs. Clearly, the exchange could not take place — one of the parties to the exchange does not agree to exchange a pair of shoes for a carton with a dozen eggs.</p>
<p>Another problem with barter, even more serious, and which makes its daily use impossible today is that it makes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_calculation_problem">economic calculation</a> impossible. The means of production in an economy have to keep track of how much they earn and how much they lose. The measurement of corporate profits or losses would be, under an exchange pattern regime subject to barter, a totally impossible challenge. In short, an exchange system such as barter would be unfeasible in an advanced/modern industrial economy. Barter could only succeed in satisfying the needs of a primitive people.</p>
<p>Despite this, man is often said to be an intelligent being, and just as science overthrew <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory">phlogiston theory</a>, humans overthrew barter. In a brilliant attempt to find a way out, one of the most positive human inventions in history would be born: the money. Money was a great leap forward for civilization in regards to man’s exchange relations and a step towards the transition to an advanced economy.</p>

<p>With all the limitations of barter cleared, the farmer could now buy a pair of shoes without the shoemaker needing his carton of a dozen eggs. Companies are not exempt from the virtues of money, now they could calculate how much they earn and how much they lose. The enjoyment of a good or service would no longer be subject to the tattered barter but to money, to money-merchandise. The problem of indivisibility would no longer exist — now an owner could sell his house charging a fixed sum of money that he will use later for the acquisition of other goods or services.</p>
<p>Companies, for their part, already know how much financial gain or loss they are presenting. Suppose, by way of example, that a medium-sized company amassed €173,235 in revenue from its production, but spent €64,582 on input maintenance and remuneration for the worker cooperative, subtracting €64,582 from €173,235 would get €108,653, which is the amount of net income of the aforementioned company. The workers would no longer be compensated for the fruit of their work and effort with something as mundane and useless as a steel bar or with countless other raw materials that would not represent a truly important utility for the worker, now they would be paid with money and with it could pay for hundreds of thousands of other goods or services.</p>
<p>The illustrious Austrian economist, Ludwig von Mises, in one of his top works entitled <a href="http://web.mit.edu/merolish/Public/books/libertarian/tmc.pdf">The Theory of Money and Credit</a>, it focused on analyzing the origin, nature and value of money, and its effect on the determination of the monetary policies of central banks. He reached several interesting conclusions, several of which are redundant — but it would be worth pointing out one that, due to its positivist nature, calls the attention of anyone who has carefully read the above. Mises wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where there is no free exchange of goods and services, there is no place for money.</p>
<p>— Ludwig von Mises (The Theory of Money and Credit, 1912, pg. 82)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://esepuba.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/lerner.pdf">The Money as a Creature of the State</a> is the epigraph under which the economist Abba Lerner published, in 1947, an article in the who defended the chartalist position against money, credit and its underlying origin. Today we know with certainty that Lerner’s position regarding the origin of money is questionable. Money arose spontaneously, and the first modalities of money appeared to us as general exchange instruments or—in other words—goods that embodied a method of payment, with a relatively stable value and available in sufficient quantities to satisfy collective demands.</p>
<p>The immediate need for an exchange pattern was increased by the teleological limitations of barter, that need was not born from a mystical idea of the State but from people outside it — who creatively sought an alternative to modest barter. Little by little, as the weaknesses of primitive money became apparent, the doors to fiduciary money would open. John Law, the proverbial economist who is known for introducing paper money in Europe, proposed the creation of a bank to manage the public finances of the French state, thus substituting gold for paper credit to increase the money supply in order to to favor the industries of yesteryear.</p>

    </figure>
  


<p>But Law’s system blurred the consequences that the intensification of the money supply would have on the value of money that he proposed. As the bills in circulation skyrocketed, Law began to lose control of his plan when a prince exchanged his bills for coins. Once the word got out, there was a run on stocks, banks, and paper money. Royal edict after royal edict was issued to silence these people now that word had gotten out that their notes were stinking fiat currency.</p>
<h2 id="from-fiat-money-to-cbdcs">From fiat money to CBDCs</h2>
<p><img src="/res/currency.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It is clear that since the introduction and subsequent internationalization of paper credit (or fiduciary money) in France at the hands of the great elites of the French State, but mainly by the idea of the great Law, many elites pulled their chins thinking for what despotic purposes such wonder could be used. The monopolization of credit and, specifically, the monopolization of who issues the currency and who manages it is something that gives governments excessive power and can lead to despotic measures — such as freezing assets for speaking out against the party ruling politician of a country or for issuing statements that are not to the exact taste of a select group of people.</p>
<p>Today, money is essentially credit, centrally issued credit that is subject to different mechanisms that allow certain classes to profit from it. The credit is issued, granted and managed by a bank that, in most cases, is accountable to no one and is not subject to any audit, but which may respond to external interests — such as the government or itself. This little-known situation of banks compared to other public institutions is, for a few, a virtue, but for people like me; a danger.</p>
<p>Attempts to “democratize” the Central Bank have failed. It is not a surprise — it is innate in bureaucrats, of course, to assault any project that ferociously intervenes in their political sewers. In 1993, Henry Barbosa González—the first Democratic chairman of the House Banking Committee—hoped to catapult his friendly bill to open the Federal Reserve to public scrutiny. The pillars of his bill were very smooth. In fact, he did not even ask for budgetary limits to be imposed to which the Federal Reserve should be confined. It only called for full audits of what was and was not done within the walls of the Federal Reserve, filming videos of decision-making meetings, and that the Federal Reserve chairmen be chosen by the president-elect of the United States.</p>
<p>It is easy to predict what was the reaction of those who are in charge of outlining public policies: a NO. From an economist of the stature of Alan Greenspan to the then 42nd president of the United States, Bill Clinton, to whom, without a doubt, these measures would have given much greater power over the monetary policy of the United States. He stated without mincing words that “they risk diminishing market confidence in the Federal Reserve”.</p>
<p>The forceful display of political integralism by the bureaucrats in the face of the refusal to approve this law is disturbing, there is no doubt about it. Leaving a glimpse of his infinitesimal, or zero interest in transparency in the face of what is done and is not done within the narrow walls of the Federal Reserve. Such would be the gains for the political leadership that, if approved, and assuming that they are doing things really well, it would be expected that the public would strengthen their confidence in the monetary authorities that steer the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>This has given rise and opened the doors to a long parade of thinkers or reformers who are tenaciously willing to wrest issuance power away from the banks — each of their proposals turns out to be better than the other but, strictly speaking: more than same. Others, perhaps unknowingly, have tried to break the Misesian and Chartalist monetary theories with an asset without prior initial demand but which aspires to establish itself as one of the semblances of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>However, central banks echoing Sun Tzu’s so representative phrase “if you can’t beat the enemy, join him” have co-opted the creation of a kind of cryptocurrency that abdicates what so distinguished traditional cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, etc): its dubious decentralization. Whoever has control of money and credit has control of everything, absolutely everything. The rise of digital currencies threatens to convert that control, which was already held to a lesser extent, by no means, closing any small “loopholes” of freedom that may still exist today.</p>
<p>This is reflected in the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/banking-giants-new-york-fed-start-12-week-digital-dollar-pilot-2022-11-15/">pilot project launched by the New York Federal Reserve</a> with the active participation of Citigroup Inc, HSBC Holdings Plc, Mastercard Inc and Wells Fargo &amp; Co with which they would seek to use digital dollar tokens in a common database to demonstrate how they can accelerate transactions and payments.</p>
<p>Surprisingly (no), such news has not been served to much discussion or gathering. No attention was paid to it and those who spoke about it did so with a smile without even having made special emphasis on its gloomy repercussions. There was no widespread discussion or debate about the excessive power that this would have over the ordinary citizen and, as if that were not enough, no official or champion of the Federal Reserve spoke out for or against what is supposed to be a pilot project structured by themselves.</p>
<p>Such indulgence paves the way for an eerily bleak future. Technology has been praised in such a way that, today, rather than being properly seen as a concern, its oligopolization is seen as a virtue. What used to be a deposit under the banner of a commercial bank will now be a deposit subject to the regulations of a central bank that will have absolute control over what, how and how much money we produce, spend and what we use it for.</p>
<p>Those who see the Nakamoto sect as a laudable way out of the dangers of centralized digital currencies is, in the first instance, not understanding that modern man, and even more so the postmodern (or hypermodern), lives in an existential wasteland that invites the creation of redemptive epics. This individual has lost everything because it is irrelevant: the economy—the only thing that matters—has been co-opted by the same oligarchies that have sullied the good name of republicanism, democracy and inclusion in the name of a universalist tyranny where values are revealed more and more abject.</p>
<p>The social democrat can dream of reformism, the libertarian must suffer disappointment. Power corrupts and makes any form of decency unfeasible. How is an individual, in his solitude and insignificance, able to take control of his existence if everything around him is absurd, surveillance, control and siege?</p>
<p>At this rate, only a new form of money emancipated from the fierce tyranny of banking can free us. And it won’t be gold, nor barter — the former will only be reserved for those deluded nostalgics who still don’t understand to what degree its price has been and continues to be manipulated by big finance. And barter should only be useful to supply the needs of a small primitive people.</p>
<p>The economy, and especially the financial one, is a fiction that is sustained by invisible threads — you have to trust that all those accounting notes that accumulate in the balance sheets of companies, commercial and central banks mean something, that there is an abundance of reserves, collateral and liquidity. More than profit and wealth, thinking about a new monetary system implies advocating for property: in a world that is increasingly centralized and weak, decentralized currency, and therefore non-confiscatable, will be the only escape route from catastrophe and slavery. And you can, contrary to what the World Economic Forum claims, <strong>be happy and own something</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="bitcoin-and-alternative-money">Bitcoin and alternative money</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Various mythical prose of classical liberalism have subtly flowed from Bitcoin</strong>. There is the one that I have already exposed as a purely Austrian stamp, vertebrate by Carl Menger in his little-discussed article <a href="https://cdn.mises.org/On%20the%20Origins%20of%20Money_5.pdf">The Origins of Money (1892)</a>, whose course maintained its consonance with other successors of the Austrian School. In the 1920s, Ludwig von Mises gave central planning a death blow by postulating the theorem of the impossibility of economic calculation in socialism, while his theory of cycles denounced credit expansions, runaway monetary emission and the fractional reserve system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <a href="https://iea.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Denationalisation%20of%20Money.pdf">Denationalisation of Money (1978)</a>, Friedrich Hayek proposes a free competition scheme for private currencies. Without central bank protection, entities would be incentivized to preserve the purchasing power of the currencies they issue, thus mitigating the main problem of monopoly: market power, or the ability to set prices above the level that would clear the markets. Unlike Mises, Hayek is a supporter of a trust scheme. In the absence of a mandatory gold standard and cash ratio, rigidities are eliminated that, in moments of uncertainty, would prevent a rapid adjustment in the structure of relative prices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>George Selgin and Lawrence White in 1994 take up the postulates of the Free Baking School to develop models of free monetary competition. Banks act like any economic agent: they maximize profits in the context of increasing marginal costs. In this case, issuing currency implies, at the margin, increasingly higher costs. Competition, the authors argue, would reduce incentives to overissue. The offer would be perfectly elastic with respect to the demand, this being the balancing mechanism of the market. Selgin and White assume that the increase in the money supply would depend, in the long term, on the rate of growth of the economy, which in turn depends on productivity, population growth, technological innovations, etc. Under competitive conditions, Selgin envisions money being perfectly neutral. By eliminating central bank intervention, market interest rates would tend to equalize the natural rate. On the contrary, the non-neutrality of money—the fact that emissions cause economic cycles—is the result of the monopoly of monetary issue.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Widespread interest in reforming or completely replacing the fiduciary system was revived after the 2008 financial crisis. Austrian authors of yesteryear are revived, the economic history of Rothbard and Jesús Huerta de Soto —the great heir to the Misean orthodoxy— is finally recognized. Even the Keynesians give way and return to the fore Hyman Minsky, author of the <a href="https://www.socialscience.international/hyman-minsky-financial-instability-hypothesis">hypothesis of financial instability</a>, analysis, by the way, cousin of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_business_cycle_theory">Austrian theory of business cycles</a>. And it is in the midst of massive bankruptcies, the Great Recession, and renewed interest in alternative explanations that Satoshi Nakamoto’s Whitepaper appears.</p>
<p>However, as I mentioned, Bitcoin disproved the regressive money theorem that Mises postulates but reaffirms Menger’s thesis. For the former, the means of exchange appear only if there is a prior non-monetary demand for potentially moneyable goods (for example, the ornamental uses of gold). For the second, the demand for liquidity conditions the genesis of money. Being born as a real financial asset (that is, without being a liability to anyone, similar to gold and unlike fiat currency), Bitcoin is pure spontaneity and, arguably, the quintessence of the free market.</p>
<p><img src="/res/1203894.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Bitcoin is agnostic only to the extent that anyone can make use of the protocol and verify it. But it is not neutral or apolitical as its less astute propagandists claim. Hanging over Nakamoto’s creature is an ethic and an axiology that openly defies the premises that feed not the Hobbesian Leviathan, but the Jouvenelenian Minotaur, the latest and most perverse invocation of the totalitarian State. The monetary rule, the 21 million, the inelasticity of the supply, are actually secondary to the soteriological promise. Bitcoin seeks to remedy the despair of the individual who is adrift in global society. In a world where it seems all avenues of escape have been blocked, cryptography represents a loophole in freedom.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, and especially maximalism—the sectarian face of the economic proposal—, emerges as an additional chapter in the history of modern gnosticisms. Its value proposition and methods for making the promise are original, but not the spirit or political theology that characterizes the protocol. Classical liberalism failed because it produced what Arendt feared: the collapse of the individual into his empty self. If the Hobbesian leviathan fed on fear, the Minotaur thrives on loss and loss of purpose: totalitarianism, explains Bertrand de Jouvenel, is only possible in a world of democratic narratives and resigned masses that surrender to the State, as well as the Cretans sacrificed their progeny to the beast of the labyrinth.</p>
<p>In this way a character less trained in Kantian gibberish like Robert Breedlove, host of the “What is Money?” podcast, can reach paroxysm and declare that Bitcoin is the first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pyrC6-J9KM">absolute human invention</a>. Creating the absolute, being subsumed by it, existing for the total mechanism that now gives life to itself, would undoubtedly be material for the greatest Borgean ecstasies. The maximalists, ontologically denied to the flat, may only be capable of intuiting the need for something that transcends them. That nihilistic rejection is not possible for everyone, that dune and apathy are the homeland of only a few —a Stavrogin, an Iván Karamázov—, is evidenced in the absurd and incessant search for the promised land, in the questionable <a href="https://www.amazon.com.mx/Thank-God-Bitcoin-Corruption-Redemption/dp/1641991216">Bitcoin Christology</a> of the Korean cowboy Jimmy Song or in the deaf dialogue that Breedlove and Jonathan Pageau had about Nakamoto’s noumenal invention. Two hours and three quarters of trifles, twists and turns and whims where the perspective of an orthodox Christian collides with the preaching of a person in need of faith, inhabitant of a vacant lot where economics preconditions salvation.</p>
<p>Nakamoto understood that abstract individualism is not enough. First of all there is the property and the meaning of things. Bitcoin rejects the absurdity posed by the fiat economy. For this, it establishes specific rules, a method, a reality where the State’s currency is sustained by a collective hallucination: the belief that collective creeds can sustain what is fictitious. Nakamoto limited himself to offering an escape route to the labyrinth, but his most vulgar faithful mistook him for Theseus. Satoshi’s fading represents the anarch’s solution that Jünger had already raised. The sovereign individual is not the one who kills the Minotaur, but the one who survives him and preserves his will on the margins.</p>
<p>But it’s not kind to bureaucrats to watch Nakamoto’s brainchild pour billions of gallons of shit onto fully centralized and fiat money. Allowing yourself to monitor what is done and what is not done within the intricacies of the highest invention of the Japanese was not possible. They knew that decentralization beats a brilliant self-determination, autonomy and, above all, self-sufficiency and freedom, how do you control something over which you have no control?</p>
<p>This latent sense of “misgovernance” that the bureaucrats saw in themselves outlined what CBDCs are today. Fiat money is no longer useful; bureaucrats have seen their already disproportionate power challenged and slowed by the rise of the mythical “decentralization” that has characterized cryptocurrencies. Thus, CBDCs were born: it transcends from paper money to the digital, to the impalpable — they no longer have to question you personally to find out how and what you use your money for. If the monopoly of the issuance of money and credit already offered the banks excessive power in the style of despotic policies.</p>
<p>This has been revealed by Christine Lagarde—president of the European Central Bank since November 2019—who, in <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2022/html/ecb.sp221107~dcc0cd8ed9.en.html">a disturbing speech</a> in which he slipped that the anonymity of cash “does not appear a viable option” in his opinion and that “being issued by the central bank, it would be different from private money” in clear reference to the development of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. In her speech, Lagarde added that “in our public consultation, 43% of respondents ranked privacy as the most important aspect of the digital euro, well ahead of other features”, I do not think I’m wrong if I say that, considering what we have already Speaking of centralized digital money, Europeans (Europeans themselves!) are concerned that the digital euro is subservient to vehement surveillance and supervision of the payment environment by the state.</p>
<p>In support of my hypothesis, the increasing supervision of cash payments and bank transactions would be an excellent confirmation of this trend towards a much more intense control of what people do with their money. On this issue, Lagarde took the floor and stated that “so it is clear that if we want the digital euro to be attractive, it needs to be designed in a way that meets people’s privacy expectations” without first warning that “but full anonymity, such as offered by cash, does not appear a viable option in my opinion”, in this way, Lagarde displays that her vision of the hypothetical digital euro would require greater control of the economic-financial movements of companies and families.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would contravene other public policy objectives such as ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules and combating the financing of terrorism. And it would also make it virtually impossible to limit the use of the digital euro as a form of investment – for example via holding limits or tiered remuneration – for which identities of users need to be known.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lagarde, in this way, catapulted her presentation to us as a balance between the social value of privacy and the public interest in preventing activities that, according to them, are illegal. It goes without saying that what he is trying to make clear to us among so many euphemisms and verbal flourishes is that they all seek greater control over the assets of companies, families and citizens. To undertake such a task, which will consist of subverting public and media opinion to position it in favor of greater State control, it’s necessary to become judge and executioner of all the information that circulates online. Human beings stumble over the same stone forever, and therefore the lack of resistance to the adoption of something as quaint but dangerous as the digital euro will not be surprising.</p>
<p>But the man, in general, is a follower. Enlightenment reason was born doomed: a god was displaced, but not even five minutes passed before new ones were invented in his place. Prophets were needed—they were called intellectuals, philosophers, revolutionary leaders—to proclaim the political theologies that would stir up the masses in need of material salvation. The story continues because despair is infinite: postmodern progressivism offers the oligophrenic mass the feeling of righteousness and relevance. Not surprisingly, then, Bitcoin has degenerated into worldly faith.</p>
<p>Man’s resignation before authority constitutes the genesis of his ontology and few have decided to rebel against it. If yesterday the State consecrated the non-vaccinated as phenomena that threaten public health; tomorrow the unruly will be consecrated as “terrorists” who only seek to hold political power through intimidation and violence. It will resort to propaganda muscles, the media and actively appeal to democratic narratives — that little reverberated phrase by Emilio Gentile according to which democracy “could become a form of repression with popular consent” will materialize. The masses, already stripped of their ontological authenticity (<strong>Dasein</strong>), will assume the role of cheers of exacerbated grandiloquence that will applaud that small oligarchic elite of bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Eric Voegelin was right in describing ideologies as projects headed for an impossible: the immanentization of the eschatological. Utopian thought emerges from this absurd search for plenitude. Combined with scientistic arrogance, blind faith in reason turns redemption into manufacturing. Saving yourself in modernity is a matter of engineering. If CBDCs were to succeed, as a self-referential and reality-producing machine, they would have achieved what Voegelin believed impossible. And that’s not the path we must follow — only a new form of money can set us free, a decentralized and unconfiscatable one that is not subject to scales or hidden frameworks of a centralized entity, such as a commercial bank or a central bank.</p>
