      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mathematics will frighten more than one who has recently been introduced to economics through some introductory course for students. Very ornate formulas and equations — with which it is often intended to banally circumscribe human behavior to only numbers — that will make a reading convoluted that was initially conceived as brilliantly simple and intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A brief introduction to the technical/historical development of PGP over the last few decades, from its creation in 1991 by cryptographer and computer scientist Philip “Phil” R. Zimmermann to the present decade, and how we can use it for our emails or instant messaging — this article will try to serve as an initiation for future articles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;That cryptocurrencies are a battle for independence from the fiat system or control of the citizenry through it should come as no surprise. Once the State assumed the helm of monetary affairs in the mid-18th century, the doors have been opened to one of the most hard-fought and divided battles: who should have the monopoly of money and credit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Genesis of the Prime Numbers Theorem</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The brilliant Greek mathematician and geometer Euclid proved that the prime numbers are infinite. Since then, the question arose as to how we could know how many natural numbers less than or equal to a given natural number, let’s say $ x $ and represented as $ \pi\left( x \right) $, are prime. This problem has been in the focus of combinatorics and analysis for over a thousand years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ll try, with this article, to make people aware of the implications that the enormous growth of TikTok is having on the privacy of millions of users and how it is being used as a kind of “weapon” against the West to stupefy an entire generation of young people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
