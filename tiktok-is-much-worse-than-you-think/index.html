    <p>I’ll try, with this article, to make people aware of the implications that the enormous growth of TikTok is having on the privacy of millions of users and how it is being used as a kind of “weapon” against the West to stupefy an entire generation of young people.</p>
<hr>
<p>It will be no secret to anyone that the COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to despotic measures. It has not only provided the ad hoc alibi for governments to fiercely confront our freedoms, but has also given rise to what José Ortega y Gasset prophetically called <strong>mass-men</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://chasbwalker.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/masses.jpeg" alt="Mass-man"></p>
<p>In a prophetic exercise, the Spanish philosopher Ortega y Gasset sculpted, more than 90 years ago, the concept of <strong>mass-men</strong> that would come to replace that of the gregarious person. The mass-men in the opposite direction, presents us with a more complete, more rigorous and more prophetic sketch that describes the existential metaphysics of life.</p>
<p>The mass-man alludes to the “common man” and understands, not something related to the crowd, not something quantitative, but a common determinant of a <strong>qualitative</strong> nature with an important social dimension. Thus, the mass-man is that bush that in a linear series of several is indistinguishable from the rest. The mass man is gregarious, dull, monotonous, puerile, frivolous, capricious and intellectually headless.</p>
<p>For Ortega y Gasset, the division of society ―for him, the most radical division― must be made between two classes of creatures: One who, in antithesis to the conformist, demands a lot of himself and accumulates difficulties and duties as a result, and those who do not demand anything of themselves, for them, to live is to be at every moment <strong>what they already are</strong>; no advances, no regressions.</p>
<p>Ortega y Gasset captured this entire vision in his magnificent work The Revolt of the Masses, which was published in 1929 during the rise of Mussolini in the Italian political hierarchy and Hitler in the German one.</p>
<h2 id="the-worrying-rise-of-tiktok">The worrying rise of TikTok</h2>
<p>TikTok was only born as recently as 2016 and has seen spectacular growth ever since. The meteoric rise to which it has been the subject, perhaps, will be the focus of analysis in the coming decades and that is, even a Google executive was concerned about the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/12/google-exec-suggests-instagram-and-tiktok-are-eating-into-googles-core-products-search-and-maps/">growing reluctance of younger generations to use Google services</a>.</p>
<p>But it is not only a proverbial and golden age for TikTok, it goes much further. <a href="https://theconversation.com/as-pandemic-measures-are-lifted-social-media-use-has-declined-with-the-exception-of-tiktok-191126">According to a survey</a>, in the United States, the adoption and daily use of TikTok is tilted more in favor of the younger generation, with 76% of those between the ages of 18 and 24 reporting having an account on the platform, while the fastest growing demographic in platform are those aged between 25 and 34 (54%).</p>
<p><img src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/486119/original/file-20220922-7052-ryenw5.PNG?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=600&amp;h=338&amp;fit=crop&amp;dpr=1" alt=""></p>
<p>This enormous growth does not float in the air, nor is it the result of chance. The fundamental actor that served as a gear for his enormous rise was confinement. <a href="https://www.artefact.com/blog/why-tiktok-has-come-of-age-during-the-covid-crisis/">By some metrics</a>, COVID-19 far from hampering growth for social media, it accelerated it. Between March 23-29, 2020, content consumption skyrocketed by 86% and average engagement by 75% as old and new users flocked to the platform.</p>
<ol>
<li>According to the Wall Street Journal, users currently spend 17.6 million hours per day on Instagram Reels, versus 197.8 million hours per day on TikTok.</li>
<li>33% of TikTok users say they regularly get their news from the app, according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/social-media-and-news-fact-sheet/">Pew Research</a>.</li>
<li>Nearly half of Gen Z is using TikTok and Instagram for search instead of Google, according to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/nearly-half-genz-use-tiktok-instagram-over-google-search-2022-7">Google’s own internal data</a>.</li>
<li>67% of teens use TikTok, second only to YouTube according to a new <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/08/10/teens-social-pew/">Pew Research poll</a>.</li>
<li>29% of consumers that have TikTok installed on their phone use it every day – <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-power-user-curve">second only to Instagram at 39%</a>.</li>
<li>TikTok screen time per user is crushing its competitors – it’s currently at 26 hours per month.</li>
<li>Douyin, aka TikTok in mainland China, just hit <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/06/douyin-tiktok-app-in-china-hits-400-million-daily-active-users/">400 million daily active users</a> there (and the most active dance video creators are <a href="https://www.katherinewu.me/writings/bytedance-tiktok-douyin-2019-report">over 60 years old!</a>).</li>
<li>Average Minutes Per User – TikTok users love the app. They spend an average of a WHOPPING <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-power-user-curve">95 minutes per day</a> (over 1.5 hours) in the platform.</li>

<p>“The monkey dances for money” is a very true saying, and sums up, to a large extent, the mechanisms with which the gears of social networks move. Twitter did the same through the condescending gesture of censoring at close range those users or trends that, for advertisers, governments and non-profit organizations, struck extraordinarily sensitive chords and <a href="https://strategylab.ca/how-facebook-influences-elections/">in 2016, Facebook became a political branch of the Republican Party, a party from which it received funding of one million dollars daily to influence American voters</a>.</p>
<p>In mid-2020, the Indian government announced that it would ban 59 Chinese apps that jeopardized “India’s national security and defense, ultimately affecting India’s sovereignty and integrity,” among the apps that India’s Ministry of Electronics and IT vetoed are TikTok, UC Browser and UC News from Alibaba Group, Shareit, CM Browser and ES File Explorer. the indian government said nation’s Computer Emergency Response Team had received many “representations from citizens regarding security of data and breach of privacy impacting upon public order issues”.</p>
<p><img src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/india-ban-apps-china.jpg?resize=768,923" alt=""></p>
<p>The ban dealt a severe blow to Bytedance, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tiktok-india-exclusive/exclusive-chinas-bytedance-says-india-tiktok-ban-causing-500000-daily-loss-risks-jobs-idUSKCN1RZ0QC">it reported in an official file</a> that he was losing approximately $500,000 per day. It was known for a fact that, before the ban, TikTok recommended and fronted content such as light child pornography, praised violence against women and religious extremism.</p>
<h3 id="tiktok-invades-your-privacy-more-than-you-think">TikTok invades your privacy more than you think</h3>
<p>Seen and considering the above, I will propose to break down two dangers of this application and its monstrous rise (1 the draconian espionage and telemetry with which it is equipped and (2 the extraordinary differences between the AI algorithm of China and the West.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/row/privacy-policy/en">privacy policies</a>, TikTok confirms to collect information such as IP address, user agent, mobile carrier, time zone settings, identifiers for advertising purposes, model of your device, the device system, network type, device IDs, your screen resolution and operating system, app and file names and types, keystroke patterns or rhythms, battery state, audio settings and connected audio devices. That’s an incredibly disproportionate amount of information!</p>
<p>So much information for the nooks and crannies of a social network that only wants you to be subordinated like a starving man from a desert is useless, unless your aspiration is to maintain 22.5% (1,800,000,000 * 100 / 8,000,000,000) of the planet under systematic surveillance in the image and likeness of China, whose preponderant political party exercises draconian surveillance over its population.</p>
<p>The discreet and ferocious abuses of your personal information do not stop there. In mid-2020, Apple finished closing a vulnerability that allowed hundreds of thousands of applications indiscriminate access to clipboard information. One of the applications detected by security researchers <a href="https://www.mysk.blog/2020/02/24/precise-location-information-leaking-through-system-pasteboard/">Talal Haj Bakry and Tommy Mysk was TikTok</a>.</p>
<p>TikTok, according to the researchers, excused itself by maintaining that the problem related to the use of an outdated Google advertising SDK that was being replaced and “is committed to protecting user privacy and being transparent about how our app works”, the researchers argued there was no way of knowing what the app might be doing with user data, and its abuse was lost among many others. One of them, without mincing words, pointed out that through the universal clipboard functionality that allows you to read anything that has been copied to your iPhone on any Apple device (Mac or iPad), TikTok would be able to deliberately capture information such as passwords, work documents, confidential emails, financial information.</p>
<p>This has not only been limited to iOS, it has been extended to Android. <a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/tiktok-in-app-keyboard-has-ability-to-track-your-text-inputs_id142030">According to a report signed by Felix Krause</a>, TikTok (Facebook and Instagram are also included) has full and free access to the clicks that are made within the mobile application via the execution of back-end code in JavaScript.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Even though the injected script doesn’t currently do this, running custom scripts on third party websites allows them to monitor all user interactions, like every button and link tapped, text selections, screenshots, as well as any form inputs, like passwords, addresses and credit card numbers.</em></p>
<p>― Felix Krause</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bytedance, the parent company, has maintained that TikTok’s servers are hosted in the United States and Singapore but this is just Bytedance’s word against <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/tik-tok-report-07282022110225.html">conclusive evidence that app subdomains are scattered in all corners of the globe</a>. TikTok, in fact, has used Oracle as a branch to host information and data of all users in the United States on its servers but they denied that they could access them.</p>
<h3 id="the-mass-man-factory">The mass-man factory</h3>
<p>TikTok is that place where the <strong>mass-men</strong>, described by Ortega y Gasset, abound. TikTok is that place that combines the illusion of “productivity” and “training” for which many young people fall thinking that they will learn more in it than by taking a book, and the most superhuman and spectacular oligophrenia that our cornea can contemplate.</p>
<p>Just go to the main page, and you will see how each video is a copy of another. Don’t think you’re seeing cockroaches and mice where there aren’t any. TikTok is a social network parasitized by fruitless content and riddled with truly harmful trends that have caused everything from hospitalizations to deaths in <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/tiktok-challenge-possibly-linked-to-teens-deadly-car-crash-1.6124342">teenagers</a> and even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jul/05/tiktok-girls-dead-blackout-challenge">children</a>.</p>
<p>The pink sauce. Sounds appetizing, right? What if I told you that this “pink sauce” is actually a combination of sunflower seed oil, raw honey, non-refrigerated milk, and vinegar? In light of the above, passing on it would be the right (and sensible) decision, but unfortunately, that was not the outcome followed by thousands of children who would see in this unhealthy concoction an opportunity for leisure. Back then, those kids headed to the hospital with pink diarrhoea.</p>
<p>Until not long ago, the cloudiness that hung over Douyin ― the name by which TikTok is known in China ― was such that it made its algorithm totally insurmountable in the face of countless attempts to confirm a <strong>speculation</strong> that resulted be true It turns out that, contrary to the Western algorithm, the Chinese algorithm praises and brings to the fore those creators who contribute to the platform through sports, academic or scientific content, as opposed to what its Western (or American) counterpart, TikTok, recommends on the main page.</p>
<p>What motivated China to do this is plain to see. The famous American podcaster, Joe Rogan, said that “they’re trying to encourage achievement, right? They’re doing all these things with like this idea of engineering a society of more accomplished, more successful people” and and reason, it is not lacking. China is looking for a way to lay the foundation for a generation of young people with formidable gifts in science and sports while using TikTok as a Trojan horse to systematically undermine the reason and intellect of young Westerners.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We shouldn’t want some other country’s tech influencing us. In China, the way the algorithm works is that it doesn’t reward people doing stupid dances and playing with their dog. The algorithm rewards things they want to see their youth do: cool engineering, cool science… but in America, it rewards twerking, stupid dances, and things that are truly worthless to society.</em></p>
<p>― Andrew Schulz (Podcaster and Comedian)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TikTok is dumbing down Western humanity and youth, stripping them of any shred of reason, insight, or common sense. And along with Facebook and Instagram, it’s creating a widespread mental health crisis that hasn’t let up. Thanks to TikTok, our hemisphere is becoming intellectually impoverished and Ortega y Gasset’s vision of the mass-man is acquiring a body in the form of a gregarious and puerile human being. The new generations are only incessantly secreting dopamine and nothing else; they do not seek to surpass themselves and avoid difficulties by sheltering themselves in a fictitious world in which they only hide a false sketch of themselves.</p>
<p>The capacity to form an autonomous judgment is dissipating and, consequently, we are divorcing ourselves from that characteristic garment that, it was assumed, made us incredibly intelligent beings. Humanity is alienating; the general interest now is to brag about how many colors you have dyed your hair, or how many tons of makeup you have on your face. And there are few who, knowingly, are predisposed to masticate the facts. People who make sterile and childish content are the ones who get all the <strong>likes</strong>, and only a few want to make a big difference. But the IA algorithm does not give truce, the content that is compensated by it is that content that is mediocre enough to purge its users of all traces of reason and intelligence.</p>
<p>But this desire to secrete dopamine in abundance will not stop, not until the risks it poses to human mental health are brought to the fore. But few parents are interested in marking an exception to what is now a common rule. Many of them, at the price of allowing the daily mental curtailment of their children ― dispossessed of a previously formed reason ― obtained a tablet or a cell phone that will allow them to enter a world they are not prepared to confront.</p>
<p>Don’t use TikTok, and if you do, uninstall it. Do not look back. And believe me, you will not regret such a decision. I have never used the application, and I have forced myself to never use it.</p>
