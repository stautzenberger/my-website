    <p>Mathematics will frighten more than one who has recently been introduced to economics through some introductory course for students. Very ornate formulas and equations — with which it is often intended to banally circumscribe human behavior to only numbers — that will make a reading convoluted that was initially conceived as brilliantly simple and intuitive.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the problems that you or anyone else will fall into when introducing yourself to economics or even wanting to start reading for some beginner to econometrics or mathematical finance will be, precisely, the extensive use of mathematics. Not all of us have a very acute reading or mental fluency to fully elucidate formulas or equations that often, given the very limits of written language, can remain uncovered as a result of the crude explanations that are usually offered.</p>
<p>Mathematical formulas give a privileged luxury to what you are saying. The metamorphosis through which an intelligible explanation passes into a highly stylized inferential statistical or linear regression model will give the reader the impression that he is not communicating with some charlatan or imbecile, but with a scientist, no longer even a social one, whose corollary is minutely supported by empirical and statistical models. You could be making a mistake, you could be wrong, or your word salad is just that, a salad full of words that don&rsquo;t say anything, expressed by Ludwig Wittgenstein as &ldquo;holiday words.&rdquo; I mean, why doubt what he&rsquo;s saying? Isn&rsquo;t mathematics, as Alain Connes put it, the &ldquo;sole and indisputable universal language&rdquo;?</p>
<p>The relevance of studying the phenomenon of endogenous crises and crises of monetary origin lies in the fact that market economies, regardless of the degree of intervention, are necessarily unstable to the extent that all praxeological processes derive from human fallibility. Conventional equilibrium models can offer clues, especially when the purpose is to describe the mechanisms of this or that phenomenon, given certain conditions, but they will never be an accurate reflection of behavior. It is not surprising that much of the criticism of economic science rests on the suspicion that, in the desire to build exquisite models, economists have moved away from what is properly anthropological. Man is reduced to a hyper-rational creature that only thinks about optimizing his circumstances, maximizing benefits, minimizing costs and incorporating economic information within his reach into his analysis.</p>
<p>Talking about the aforementioned models inevitably leads us to talk about why they are accepted almost unanimously by orthodox, classical and/or neoclassical economists — as it is usually known among economic historians to effectively distinguish between the Smithian, Ricardian, and Marxist traditions — who have shown great reluctance to divorce themselves from clairly counterintuitive models. Following this opinion, it should be pointed out that, in fact, at least for Grigory Mankiw the uncritical adoption of these models that presuppose a consequentialism in the development of economic agents, as well as the entrenched refusal to abjure them, obeys — according to Mankiw — a that &ldquo;even if not exactly true, may be true enough that it yields reasonably accurate models of behavior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In line with the endless reasons that motivate those misgivings on the part of the orthodox and neoclassical to adopt more holistic models, we can move to econometrics. Just shedding light on them will make us find parallels here and there with what Mankiw has already said regarding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus">Homo economicus</a> that is pondered in neoclassical models on the analysis of consumer behavior.</p>
<p>At the end of September 1973, Axel Leijonhufvud — Swedish economist and avid student of monetary theory — published an ethnographic satire entitled <strong>The Life Among Econ</strong> in which he recounted in great detail existing customs, relationships and taboos among economists. While the <em>Micro</em> exasperatedly ponders its superiority over the <em>Macro</em>, the <em>Macro</em> does the same by pondering it as well. Above <em>Micro</em> and <em>Macro</em>, however, is the priestly caste known as <em>Math-Econ</em>, a term by which Leijonhufvud refers to the often vigorous and impeccable mathematical models. Despite its practical use, it is often conspicuous by its absence, the more elegant, pretentious and mammoth the <em>Math-Econ</em>, the higher the status of its owner.</p>
<p>The opinions in this regard will diverse but, in my opinion, what is most rewarded in the wide of the hierarchy of economic science are essentially ideas and inventions such as high-robustness models or theories. However, as the economic science of a social science is treated — according to Paul Samuelson, it is not only a social science but the &ldquo;queen of social sciences&rdquo; — the observations are not homogeneous but heterogeneous. For the purpose of performing a good praxis, each analysis carried out analyzes hundreds of aspects as a whole. Each observation is a unique and unrepeatable event caused by a particular individual response. Consequently, a probability distribution cannot be established. Again, the probability distribution is based on the assumption that we are dealing with a non-particular event and, therefore, repeatable.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take business activities for example. If these activities were repeatable with known probability distributions, then we would not need entrepreneurs. After all, an entrepreneur is an individual who organizes his activities to know the future requirements of consumers. The requirements of people, however, are never constant with respect to a particular good. The assumption that makes the economic (that the probability distribution exists and can be quantified) leads to absurd results.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the idea that economic or financial risks can be calculated is attractive and everyone likes it. However, it is not risk that we face, but uncertainty. And even more, financial mathematics can calculate a risk with apparent accuracy, but the question is from what data and under what reality is this risk calculated? The problem is that economic data (almost all of it) is not a segment of the real world that we access directly, but is the result of a creation process that we carry out according to certain protocols. Because most economic and financial data is not discovered, but fabricated. And this affects both the balance sheet data of a bank and the macroeconomic data of a country.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mathematics brought rigor to economics. Unfortunately it also brought mortis.</p>
<p>— Kenneth Ewart Boulding</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such is the importance of predictive models that since the dawn of economic science, the outline of a model with the ability to predict what will happen in the future has been systematically sought. During this search — undertaken by both philosophers and mathematicians — they have gone from looking for qualitative models (oracles) to quantitative models (empirical mathematical models). The center of the discussion, however, is whether the future can be predicted through it and, if so, are they enough to satisfy that need?</p>
<p>To improve the accuracy of an economic model as a prognosis tool, economics often use several ingenious tricks. The predictive capacity of each equation in the model is compared to the real data, and the difference between the real data and the data obtained from the equations, also known as the addition factor, is extrapolated forward and incorporated into the equations of the model.</p>
<p>Economic behavior is primarily grounded in development. The economic agent is continually in a situation of uncertainty given the intrinsic linear condition of time, and the probabilistic condition of the universe that determines the future. Its preparation and structuring depends on him, on the economic agent himself and, for this purpose, he can invoke rewinding with the purpose of abstracting and inquiring information that may be useful to him in the future. You must also abstract and inquire information from the here and now with the intention of structuring a clearer and more comprehensive scheme of expectations. These data syncretization processes are essential, and must be combined with a comparison that facilitates the improvement of the retained information.</p>
<p>The reluctance to act in an environment of uncertainty reminds us faithfully of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox">St. Petersburg Paradox</a> of probability theory, first observed by Nicolaus Bernoulli — of the prominent Bernoulli&rsquo;s family of mathematicians/physicists — with a casino that offers a single player game of chance in which the fair coin is tossed at each stage. The initial bet is given with 2 dollars and is doubled every time heads appear. The first time tails are thrown, the game ends and the player wins whatever is in the pot. Thus, the player wins 2 currency units if the first toss comes up tails, 4 currency units if the first toss comes up heads and the second toss tails, 8 currency units if the first two toss comes up heads and the third toss tails.</p>
<p>The paradox underlines that a rational decision in a betting game is strictly subordinated to the amount that each bet deployed. Obviously, no properly rational being would turn to the decision to bet an amount of money close to infinity despite the persistent theoretical indication that such a decision is rational. This problem — which, at the time, constituted the center of research for Nicolaus — found its solution in 1738 in a work entitled <strong>Specimen theoriae novae de mensura sortis</strong>, written by the polymath Daniel Bernoulli.</p>
<p>Similar situations can be found in the statistical models used by economists in order to approximate credit risk. The methodology underlying the credit risk estimation models is marked by the one developed for market risk, whose genesis is in the works of economist Henry Markowitz, JP Morgan Chase developed in 1989 a model to measure the market risk of its balance sheet (Riskmetric). Later, in 1997, they developed another model to measure credit risk (Creditmetric).</p>
<p>In both cases, the central idea was the concept of value at risk, which assumes the statistical modeling of the losses of a portfolio of financial instruments as possible and, furthermore, that these losses are distributed according to a normal statistical distribution. The question was that for market risk there was (and there is) sufficient and independent data to assume its statistical modeling, while for credit risk there was (nor are there) hardly any data or frequencies, which is why it was necessary to manufacturing.</p>
<p>In this way, the modeling of credit risk became dependent on the credit ratings granted by the rating agencies and on valuation models that, in the absence of market signals and sufficient data to which to apply the statistical methodology, have data must be extrapolated from other credit references with which there is supposedly a link, or the data must be fabricated to create a non-existent statistical history (internal ratings) to feed the mathematical models with them.</p>
<p>Consequently, by having to resort to this methodology, the credit risk assessment process is extremely vulnerable, not only due to the poor quality of the information used, but also due to the complexity of the models and the validity of the hypotheses in which they are based. support each other, in most cases impossible to contrast.</p>
<p>And this is so because, unlike market risk, credit risk is a phenomenon with estimation difficulties dominated by asymmetric information and the opacity of relevant information (on debtors, causes of default, etc.). For this reason, the assignment of probabilities of default to debtors that have never defaulted is nothing more than an illusion. Furthermore, I believe that trying to construct some kind of reliable indicator of the degree of future compliance of a current debtor is an impossible claim. The facts either do not exist or, by far, are too few for them to be the object of calculating probabilities. Statistics can be applied only when we have classes of data that can be considered infinite masses.</p>
<p>It is for such reasons that econometrics and, consequently, financial mathematics and statistics are nothing more than a tool that only a select group of economists make use of in order to axiomatize and provide empirical support for each of the postulates that they intend to exhibit. The best thing, in my opinion, is to see econometric models as fables, not for nothing the philosopher Allan Gibbard and the economist Hal Varian did not hesitate to say that &ldquo;every [economic] model tells its own story.&rdquo; Nancy Cartwright — American philosopher — uses the &ldquo;fable&rdquo; with both economic models and models expounded in physics. Unlike fables, where the moral is clear, Cartwright argues that economic models require great care and interpretation in order to draw the political conclusion. This complexity stems from the fact that each model captures a single conceptual truth, a conclusion applicable to a specific setting.</p>
<p>Men and societies are more than data, balance sheets and macroeconomic data. Hence, the elaboration of theories that explore social processes as a whole becomes an ethical imperative. It is precisely the reductionism to the observation of data and variables that has ended up vulgarizing the economic analyzes of the last century. As if the price to be paid for mathematical elegance were the human spirit underlying economics. Historical development has shown us that the human being has not generally exhibited, at any time in history, the hyper-rationality that neoclassical and econometric models presuppose.</p>
