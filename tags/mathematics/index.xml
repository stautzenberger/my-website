      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mathematics will frighten more than one who has recently been introduced to economics through some introductory course for students. Very ornate formulas and equations — with which it is often intended to banally circumscribe human behavior to only numbers — that will make a reading convoluted that was initially conceived as brilliantly simple and intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The brilliant Greek mathematician and geometer Euclid proved that the prime numbers are infinite. Since then, the question arose as to how we could know how many natural numbers less than or equal to a given natural number, let’s say $ x $ and represented as $ \pi\left( x \right) $, are prime. This problem has been in the focus of combinatorics and analysis for over a thousand years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
